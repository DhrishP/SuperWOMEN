Here are some of the important women's rights and laws in India:

Right to Equality: The Constitution of India guarantees the right to equality to all citizens, regardless of gender. This means that women have equal rights to men in all spheres of life, including education, employment, property, and political participation.
Right to Education: The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, makes it mandatory for the government to provide free and compulsory education to all children, including girls, from the age of 6 to 14 years.
Right to Employment: The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of gender and ensures that women are paid equal wages for equal work.
Right to Property: The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, and the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, give women equal rights to property as men.
Right to Political Participation: The Constitution of India guarantees the right to vote and the right to contest elections to all citizens, regardless of gender. This means that women have equal rights to participate in the political process.
In addition to these constitutional and statutory rights, there are a number of other laws and regulations that protect the rights of women in India. These include:

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005: This law provides protection to women from domestic violence, including physical, emotional, and economic abuse.
The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013: This law prohibits sexual harassment of women at work and provides for a mechanism to redress complaints of sexual harassment.
The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961: This law provides for maternity leave and other benefits to working women.
The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961: This law prohibits the demand and acceptance of dowry in connection with marriage.
The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986: This law prohibits the depiction of women in an indecent or derogatory manner.
These are just a few of the many laws and regulations that protect the rights of women in India. It is important to note that these laws are constantly evolving and new laws are being enacted to protect the rights of women.

If you are a woman in India and you believe that your rights have been violated, you can contact the National Commission for Women (NCW) or the Women's Commission in your state. The NCW and the Women's Commissions are government bodies that have been set up to protect the rights of women. They can provide you with counseling and support, and they can also help you to file a complaint against the person or institution that has violated your rights.
[1:06 pm, 30/09/2023]  The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987: This law prohibits the practice of sati, which is the ritual immolation of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre.
The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956: This law prohibits trafficking in women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971: This law gives women the right to safe and legal abortion.
The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955: This law sets out the conditions for marriage, divorce, and maintenance under Hindu law.
The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937: This law sets out the conditions for marriage, divorce, and maintenance under Muslim law.
The Domestic Violence Rules, 2006: These rules provide the procedural framework for implementing the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.
The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Rules, 2013: These rules provide the procedural framework for implementing the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.
In addition to these laws, there are a number of other laws and regulations that protect the rights of women in India, such as those relating to education, employment, property, and political participation.

It is important to note that these laws are only effective if they are implemented properly. There is a need to raise awareness of these laws among women and to ensure that they have access to the necessary resources to enforce their rights.
[1:09 pm, 30/09/2023]  1. Right Against Being Stalked
The IPC's Section 354D allows for legal action to be taken against an offender who follows a woman, makes repeated attempts to get in touch with her to foster personal interaction despite obvious disinterest, or keeps tabs on how she uses the internet, email, or any other form of electronic communication.
2. Right Against Workplace Harassment
A woman has the right to report any form of sexual harassment at her place of employment under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act. She has three months from the date of the act's passage to file a written complaint with an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at a branch office.

[1:22 pm, 30/09/2023]  The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 According to the International Research Centre for Women, almost 47 percent of girls are married before the age of 18. Currently, India ranks 13 in the world when it comes to child marriages. Since child marriage has been steeped into the Indian culture and tradition since centuries, it has been tough eliminating it. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act was made effective in 2007. This act defines child marriage as a marriage where the groom or the bride are underage, that is, the bride is under 18 years of age or the boy is younger than 21 years. Parents trying to marry underage girls are subject to action under this law. Since the law makes these marriages illegal, it acts as a major deterrent. Special Marriage Act, 1954 The objectives of this act is to provide – a special form of marriage in certain cases, provide for registration of certain marriages and, to provide for divorce. In a country like India and with the diverse religions and cast, when people from different faiths and caste chose to get married they do it under the Special Marriage Act. It is not applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir and also extends to intending spouses who are Indian nationals and living abroad. Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 According to this act, taking or giving of dowry at the time of the marriage to the bride or the bridegroom and their family is to be penalised. Dowry system, giving and taking of dowry, is a norm in India. Dowry is often asked of the bride and her family by the groom and his family. The system has taken strong roots because women after marriage move in with their spouse and in-laws. Also, over the centuries, the lack for economic independence of women and the taboo towards divorce has resulted in bride burning. When demands for dowry even after marriage are not met by the girl’s families, many women are tortured, beaten and even burnt. It is one of the major challenges that our society is grappling with. Women openly complaining about it has helped to spread the word and encourage other women to take a stand. Indian Divorce Act, 1969 The Indian Divorce Act allows the dissolution of marriage, mutual consent, nullity of marriage, judicial separation and restitution of conjugal rights. Family Courts are established to file, hear, and dispose of such cases. Maternity Benefit Act,1861 This act regulates the employment of women and maternity benefits mandated by law. It states that a woman employee who has worked in an organisation for a period of at least 80 days during the 12 months preceding the date of her expected delivery is entitled to receive maternity benefits, which includes maternity leave, nursing breaks, medical allowance, etc. Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act,1971 The Act came into effect into 1972, was amended in 1975 and 2002. The aim of the Act is to reduce the occurrence of illegal abortion and consequent maternal mortality and morbidity. It clearly states the conditions under which a pregnancy can be ended or aborted and specifies the persons qualified to conduct the same. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 To ensure women’s safety at workplace, this Act seeks to protect them from sexual harassment at their place of work. Thirty-six percent of Indian companies and 25 percent among MNC’s are not complaint with the Sexual Harassment Act according to a FICCI-EY November 2015 report. Sexual harassment at workplace also includes – the use of language with sexual overtones, invasion of private space with a male colleague hovering too close for comfort, subtle touches and innuendoes. Indecent Representation of Women(Prevention) Act,1986 This Act prohibits indecent representation of women through advertisement or in publications, writings, paintings, figures or in any other manner. National Commission for Women Act, 1990 The National Commission for Women (NCW) is a statutory body of the Government of India, established in January 1992. Lalitha Kumaramangalam was appointed its Chairperson in 2014. The NCW represents the rights of women in India and provides a voice for their issues and concerns. The National Commission for Women Act aims to improve the status of women and worked for their economic empowerment. Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 This Act prevents discrimination in terms of remuneration. It provides for payment of equal recompense to men and women workers. It is necessary to know these and other laws in place to protect the interests of women. Only if you are aware of your rights can you fight against any injustice meted out to you at home, at the workplace, or in the society.

A Comprehensive Guide to Women’s Legal Rights
Prepared by
For Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur
Legal Training Workshop
November 1 – 3, 2018
Introduction
This comprehensive guide to women’s legal rights has been prepared to give a basic exposure to
students and staff of IIT Kanpur. It forms the resource material for conducting a 3-day workshop
on legal rights and addresses a wide spectrum of concerns.
It is meant to help the participants of the workshop to negotiate their rights and understand the
remedies available to them when rights are violated. Though most women hesitate to approach
courts or the police to enforce their rights, knowledge of law is essential to understand the
boundaries of law and to negotiate for securing the rights with the background of law. Written in
a simple and lucid language, using a question and answer format, it deals with the entire gamut of
rights ranging from the Constitutional scheme of rights and moves on to specific domains such as
rights within marriage, violence against women, health and safety, rights under labour laws and
other related statutes.
The emphasis is not on exposing the participants to complicated and confusing legal provisions
contained in various statutes. Instead the focus is on interpreting the legal provisions in a manner
to protect rights and provide simple solutions to the problems faced by women.
The aim of writing this book is to spread legal awareness and accurate information about legal
rights to women across class and social hierarchies. It fits into the broader framework of Majlis
of spreading legal awareness and making rights accessible.

1. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES
1. Constitutional Scheme
Introduction
The Constitution is the basic document which governs our rights and lays down the
structure by which we are governed. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar is referred to as the Father
of the Indian Constitution as he headed the Constituent Assembly and played an
important part is including individual and political rights against the state as well as
group rights / socio-cultural rights of the marginalized section.
Our constitution is the largest and most detailed in the world. It reflects the
Democratic set up of Government.
The Preamble is the soul of the Constitution. It includes the purpose, objectives and
policies underlying provisions, in the Constitution. Important words includeSovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic and Justice, Equality and
Fraternity.
The Constitution contains a set of fundamental principles by which our nation is
governed. Every law enacted by the government has to be in conformity with the
Constitution. It spells out the Fundamental Rights and Duties of citizens.
Directive Principles of State Policy and Universal Adult Franchise are two important
parts of the Constitution.
The Constitution creates checks and balances through Separation of Powers and the
power of Judicial Review. It stipulates a combination of Federal and Unitary style of
government. It provides for an independent Judiciary and Election Machinery. The
Constitution offers Single Citizenship to citizens. Emergency Provisions are detailed
for extra ordinary situations

Article 48 - Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
Article 48A - Improve our environment and safeguard forest
Article 49- Monuments, Places and Objects of National Importance
Article 50 - Separation of Judiciary from Executive
Article 51 - International Peace and Security
What is the Difference between Fundamental Rights and Directive
Principles?
If a fundamental right is violated, a citizen who is affected or anyone else in public
interest can approach a higher court and get it struck down. The Directive Principles
are not binding on the state, but these principles must reflect in all state policies.
However, if these are violated, there is no right to go to court and get it strike down.
Which are the important provisions which protect dignity of
women?
Article 21 which deals with right to life has been expanded to include the right to
Life with Dignity. This provision has been invoked to safeguard the rights of women
such as right to divorce, to live a life free from violence and the right to safe
abortions.
Article 51A of the Constitution lays down fundamental duties of all citizens. It
stipulates that all citizens have a duty to promote harmony and to renounce practices
which are derogatory to the dignity of women.
Formal Equality and Substantive Equality
One of the main pillars of the Indian Constitution is the principle of equality. Article
14 guarantees equality before law and equal protection of law to all its citizens.
Articles 15 (1) and 16 (2) expand this principle further and prohibit discrimination on
the basis of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. This ensures that there is no
discrimination between men and women, upper castes and lower castes, rich and
4
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
poor and all will be treated as equals before the law and will be provided equal
protection of law.
Hence, if any law is passed or any action is taken to prevent women from taking up
employment in government or public sector undertaking, such law or action by the
concerned authority can be struck down by the Supreme Court or a High Court, as
being against the Constitutional provisions. Similarly paying women lower salaries
for doing the same work even when they are qualified for it, is discriminatory and
against the Constitutional guarantee of equality. Similarly not employing dalits or
Muslims in certain categories of government jobs would also amount to
discrimination.
But most important of all within the scheme of equality are Articles 15(3) (4) and 16
(3) (4) which help to further strengthen the concept of equality by permitting the state
to make special provisions for securing the rights of the marginalized sections
(women, children, schedule castes and schedule tribes) in order to help them to
overcome the discrimination they have suffered for many centuries and to help them
to become equal to others. This is called ―positive discrimination‖.
This has helped the state to enact special laws for women and children such as the
provisions for maintenance of women and children, protection against domestic and
sexual violence, the Maternity Benefits Act, special protection for women under all
labour laws, a special law to prevent sexual harassment at workplace, or reservations
for women, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes for jobs and in elected bodies. A
similarly a law to prevent atrocities against scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
does not violate the provision of equality as it is meant to give additional protection
to certain backward sections. These are all beneficial legislations meant to improve
the status of marginalized people.
Therefore: while discrimination against women has been prohibited, there is
nothing to prevent the state from making laws to provide them with extra
facilities or for taking precautions to prevent their exploitation or abuse.

Separation of Powers
1. Legislative: The Parliament of India is the supreme legislative body. Composed
of the President of India and the houses- the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and
the Lok Sabha (House of the People).
2. Executive: The Prime Minister of India, as addressed in the Constitution of
India, is the chief of the government, chief adviser to the President of India, head
of the Council of Ministers and the leader of the majority party in the parliament
and leads the executive branch of the Government of India.
3. Judiciary: There are various levels of judiciary in India – different types of
courts. The Supreme Court of India at the top, followed by High Courts of
respective states with district judges sitting in District Courts and Magistrates of
Second Class and Civil Judge (Junior Division) at the bottom.
Checks and Balances
The three bodies mentioned in the Constitution act in harmony with one and other.
The Legislature has the power to create and change the law, the Judiciary has the
power to interpret the law and to ensure that it is within the Constitutional
framework and the Executive has the power to put the law into action.
Power of Judicial Review
The judiciary has the power to interpret the Constitution and to review any law
passed by the legislature and executive order and to declare it void if it finds that the
same is in conflict with the Constitution.
This power is given by Article 32 to the Supreme Court and by Articles 226 and 227
to the High Courts.
Public Interest Litigation and Habeas Corpus
6
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
What is Public Interest Litigation (PIL)? How can it be used to protect the
rights of marginalized people?
Our constitution gives all citizens the right to approach the court when their
fundamental rights are violated. But in many instances, the person or class of people
whose rights are violated, due to their poverty, illiteracy and socially disadvantaged
position cannot approach the court to explain their plight as they lack the knowledge
and resources to do so. Many a times social organizations (a local NGO etc.) or a
journalist may take the case and write a letter to the Supreme Court or file a petition
in the Supreme Court on behalf of the person whose rights are violated. This
procedure of allowing any other person or organization to bring the fact of gross
violation of rights of a disadvantaged group of persons or an individual is called
Public Interest Litigation. The court verifies if it is done for personal gains or to
advance a genuine cause. Sometimes the courts have also acted on the basis of a
newspaper report and have asked the government to explain the situation. If any
violations are noticed by the superior court, strict action will be taken.
What is Habeas Corpus? How does this remedy protect the rights of people?
Many a times when a person is arrested by police, the family gets no further news
about the person and sometimes the person dies in police custody due to torture. So
when details of a person who is arrested by police are not known, the relatives or
friends can approach the High Court or the Supreme Court seeking the intervention
of the court to direct the police to produce the missing person in court. The exact
meaning of these Latin words is ―produce the body‖ and the actual meaning is to
produce the person physically in court (or his body if he has been killed in police
custody). This is a very powerful weapon in the hands of the people against police
atrocities.
2. Hierarchy of Courts
How are rights enforced?
7
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
The rights located in the Constitution and in various laws are enforced by our courts.
The courts interpret the laws and apply them to the facts of each case. The
Constitution lays down the hierarchy of courts and also the role and functions of
each court. The lower courts are divided into civil and criminal. Appeal from a lower
court lies with court immediately above it. Most states have a High Court. Appeal
from High Courts lie with the Supreme Court which is the highest court in India.
What is the hierarchy of our courts - The following diagram shows the
hierarchy of the courts in our country.

3. Explanation of some Legal Terms in Criminal
Law
The criminal proceedings start with the filing of a complaint. The power of the
police officer to investigate the crime is based on whether the offence is of a serious
type or a lesser serious type. Accordingly the offences are categorized as bailable
and non-bailable, cognizable and non-cognizable and compoundable and noncompoundable.
Difference between a bailable and a non-bailable Offence: If a person is arrested
for a bailable offence, the police can immediately release him on personal surety.
He/she does not have to be produced in court. Non-bailable offences are of a more
serious type, which invoke higher punishment (imprisonment for a period of three or
more years). In such cases the police does not have the power to grant bail. Serious
crimes such as rape, murder, dowry death, cruelty to wives, etc. come within its
purview. However, even in these cases, when the accused person is produced
before the magistrate, he/she has a right to file an application for bail, and the
magistrate has the power to grant him/her bail. If he/she does not have a lawyer the
person is entitled to legal aid for the purpose of making this application.
If the person is apprehensive that he will be arrested for a criminal offence, he/she
file an application for anticipatory bail in advance and avoid the arrest for a limited
period of time. If anticipatory bail is granted, even if an FIR is registered, the police
will investigate the matter without arresting the accused.
Difference between Cognizable and Non-cognizable
Offences are also further categorized as cognizable and non-cognizable. The
following table provides the difference between these two types of offences

They can then apply for bail.
Bail will be granted at the
discretion of the magistrate /
judge, depending upon the
gravity of the crime, the
chances of intimidating the
witnesses or the type of
influence the accused person
has in the area.
Accused / accomplice will not

the accused and warn him.
Outcome The Police will investigate
and collect evidence. If there
is sufficient evidence, they
will file Charge Sheet and
trial will commence.
It creates evidence of the
harassment the woman is
facing.
Jurisdiction In a cognizable offence the
jurisdiction of the police
station is immaterial to get a
complaint registered under
the FIR register.
In order to get a noncognizable offence registered
it is essential to ensure that the
crime has taken within the
jurisdiction of the police
station.
Offences such as rape, sexual harassment of women or violating their modesty,
dowry death, abetment to suicide, cruelty to wives, causing grievous hurt, etc. are all
cognizable offences, where the police are bound to register the FIR and start the
investigations.
If an offence is non-cognizable, then the police cannot start the investigations. The
person would have to approach the magistrate court and seek directions for the
police to start the investigation. Simple assault, abuse, etc. come within this
category.
10
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
The main reason why an NC complaint is filed is to create a record (proof) of
violence which will help the person in case the person has to file a criminal
complaint later. For instance, if the husband is abusive or threatens to throw the wife
out of the house, she can approach the police station and register an NC complaint.
Later if she want to file for divorce on the ground of cruelty, the NC complaint will
provide the proof that the woman was also subjected to cruelty and abuse earlier.
Compoundable and Non-compoundable Offences
The criminal law permits some minor offences to be ―compromised‖ or ―settled‖
between the parties. A detailed list of these is provided under Section 320 of Cr,.PC.
These are termed as ―compoundable‖ offences. However, major offences such as
rape, murder, decoity, dowry death, cruelty to wives, etc. cannot be compromised
between the parties. Only the higher courts, i.e. the concerned High Court or the
Supreme Court has the auhority to compound these offences. Hence these are
termed as ―non-compoundable‖ offences.

II. RIGHTS WITHIN MARRIAGE
4. Matrimonial Rights of Women
Introduction
In India, upon marriage, women leave their parental homes and live in the home
provided by the husband or by his family members. This home is called her
matrimonial home. (In fact traditionally it is believed that after marriage a woman
has rights only in her husband‘s home and not in her parental home, though legally
the position is now changed and today women have a right of residence in both
parental as well as the matrimonial home.)
The contract of marriage creates a legal obligation upon the husband and his family
members to provide a shelter and maintenance to the wife. In our society, a woman
is perceived as a home maker, in addition to all other roles she may be required to
perform. So while women have the burden of managing the house, cooking for the
family, raising the children and tending to the sick, their chances of earning an
adequate income to support themselves or even the chances of retaining their premarriage jobs are constrained. Hence when economic support is withdrawn due to a
matrimonial conflict, most women are rendered destitute. The situation becomes
dismal when they have the additional burden of caring for their children. Women‘s
right to shelter and maintenance is located within this conceptual framework.
There are various legal provisions which are meant to safeguard the rights of the
wife in her husband‘s home and to ensure that she can live there with dignity and
safety. The husband and his family cannot deprive her of these rights. They cannot
harass a wife for dowry and inflict violence upon her. If a situation of domestic or
sexual violence arises, the wife can avail of legal remedies under criminal as well as
civil laws. The wife also has a right to file for divorce and opt out of the marriage.
She also has a right to custody of her children.

High Court
―The UNICEF in 2000 noted that ‗unpaid care work is the foundation of
human experience‘. The care work is that which is done by a woman as a
mother. The woman herself will be the last person to give this role an
economic value. But when we are evaluating the loss suffered by the child
because her mother died in an accident, we must give a monetary value to the
12
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
work of a caregiver, for after all, the home is the basic unit on which our
civilized society rests...".
Note: All women, across religions and regions are entitled to the rights discussed
below, unless specifically mentioned otherwise.
a. Right to live in the Matrimonial Home
What is a matrimonial home?
When a woman is married, she acquires the right to live in her husband‘s home. This
home becomes the woman‘s matrimonial home. Even if it is not owned by her
husband and is in the name of his parents or siblings, she still has a right to reside in
this house and she cannot be thrown out of this house. A widow cannot be thrown
out from the house in which she was living with her husband, after her husband‘s
death. It does not matter if the house was not owned by her husband.
The term used in the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (Domestic
Violence Act or DV Act, for short) is ―shared household‖
A shared household is where the woman resides or has resided (i.e. has left or has
been thrown out) with the man in a domestic relationship [S. 2(s) of the DV Act].
It does not matter that the shared household is not owned by either the woman or the
man i.e. the house is on lease / license or joint family property. This right is
protected under S. 17 of the Domestic Violence Act. If she is thrown out the court
can pass an order to put her back in the home. The court can also ask the respondent
to provide alternative accommodation if the woman does not want to return to a
violent home.
How can a woman protect this right?
In order to protect this right, a woman must first believe that by virtue of her
marriage, she has acquired a right to reside in her husband‘s home and she cannot be
dispossessed from this home. Most often, women lose their right to their matrimonial
home because they themselves do not believe that they have a right to reside there.
Even when they are asked to leave the home, they must believe that they have a right
13
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
to reside in the home and this right can be protected by law. This is the first step.
Only when women believe this, the right can be protected by law.
If there is an apprehension that she will be thrown out of this house, she must
approach a magistrate‘s court under the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act
and obtain an order of injunction to restrain her husband or his family members from
dispossessing her (throwing her out) from her matrimonial home (Ss.17, 19 of DV
Act). This will secure her right of residence in this house. In the event that the
husband or his family members violate this order they will be liable for punishment
under the Domestic Violence Act. (S.31 of DV Act).
A woman will be deprived of this right only when an alternate accommodation of a
permanent nature is provided for her. Until such time, her right to reside in the
matrimonial home will be protected by the court.
Caution: The term ‗right of residence‘ cannot be construed to mean ownership
rights or right to a share in the property. Women‘s right to property is discussed
under a separate section. In India we do not have a right to matrimonial property
which is owned by the husband or his family members. However, despite this
limitation, the right of residence is an important right for most women, and this right
is protected under the Domestic Violence Act.
b. Right to claim Maintenance for self and children
What is Maintenance?
The law imposes a legal obligation on the husband to provide maintenance to his
wife. If he fails to provide for her, the wife can approach the court for an order of
maintenance.
The term ―maintenance‖ is the amount required for a decent living, including cost of
food, shelter (if the same is not provided by the husband), travel, requirements of
health care, educational, extra-curricular and recreational expenses of children, and
other sundry expenses.
Who can claim maintenance?
Under our law, the wife, minor children, major children who suffer from physical or
mental disabilities, unmarried major daughters and aged parents are entitled to
maintenance as they are unable to maintain themselves.
Can the wife claim maintenance for her children along with herself?
14
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
Yes, the wife can claim maintenance for herself and her children. If the children are
living separately along with their mother, they also have an independent right to
claim maintenance from their father.
If a woman is working, can she still claim maintenance?
Even if a woman is working, she can claim maintenance, if her husband‘s income is
substantially more than her income and she is unable to maintain herself or her
children from that income. If the husband and wife are earning the same amount,
she cannot claim maintenance from him. But in such a situation, women can claim
maintenance for their children.
Can a woman who is living with her husband claim maintenance?
Yes, if her husband is not providing her maintenance while she is living in the same
house with him, she has a right to claim maintenance.
Can women claim maintenance during divorce?
Yes. If a woman files for divorce, in the same petition, she can also claim interim
and permanent maintenance for herself and for her children. Along with this she
also needs to make a separate application for interim maintenance which can be
taken up at the initial stage and decided so she will start getting some maintenance
while her petition for divorce is pending in the court.
If her husband has filed for divorce, as soon as she received the papers, she can
immediately file an application for interim maintenance which will be heard and
decided first as a preliminary issue.
Is a woman entitled to claim maintenance after her divorce?
Yes. Even after divorce, if she has not received a lump sum amount as alimony,
which is adequate to meet her expenses, she can claim maintenance from her
husband until she remarries.
If during litigation, the husband agrees to take the wife back will she still be
entitled to maintenance?
Usually, in order to prevent an order of maintenance being passed against him, the
husband may volunteer to take the wife back or may even file proceedings for
―restitution of conjugal rights‖. If a woman is keen to reconcile with her husband,
she may accept this offer, but if there is a history of violence, then she must exercise
15
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
caution before accepting it, because once an order is passed dismissing the petition
on the ground that the parties have reconciled, it will be difficult for the woman to
start the proceedings all over again, as it would be deemed that she has condoned (or
forgiven) the husband his earlier acts of cruelty.
Hence, it is advisable to stipulate certain conditions or even keep the proceedings
pending in the court for a few months, to ensure that the husband is sincere in his
offer of reconciliation and is not doing so only to avoid payment of maintenance,
before the earlier petition is withdrawn.
What is the criterion to decide the amount of maintenance?
The amount of maintenance awarded should be sufficient to meet the regular
household expenses, children‘s educational, medical, recreational expenses, to pay
the rent of the dwelling house, etc. It should be sufficient to meet the basic needs of
a person. Here the standard of life that a person is used to is also taken into
consideration. For instance if the husband is very rich and the wife is used to that life
style she will be given a higher amount than a person earning a modest income
where the wife is used to a modest life. Hence it is important to collect evidence to
prove the husband‘s lifestyle and income such as type of house, area of the house,
type of car or two wheeler, property details, trips to foreign countries etc.
The exact amount is decided as per the income of the husband and the needs of the
wife and children.
Tips: Many a times, husbands try to show that their earnings are far less than
their actual income by showing old salary slips or by hiding their additional
income. So it is necessary for the wife to get all the information before
approaching the court, and collect the necessary details – recent salary record,
bank statements, income from business or from family property, income tax
returns etc.
Is it necessary to file for divorce while filing for maintenance?
No. If the woman does not wish to file for divorce, she can make an application only
for maintenance. This can be done under the provisions of S.125 Cr.PC or under the
Domestic Violence Act without filing for divorce.

5. Rights of Mothers to Custody of Children
Introduction
Right of custody of their children is a very important concern for women facing
domestic abuse. Due to the fear of losing custody of their children, many women
continue to live in violent relationships and are afraid of taking legal recourse to end
the violence. Since earlier the father was considered as the ―natural guardian‖ there
is a belief prevalent in society that the children belong to the husband and his family
and the woman has no claim over them and that her role is confined to only taking
care of them. When women leave their matrimonial home, they are often warned
that they will not be able to get custody of their children and further, they will not be
even able to meet them. But over years, due to sustained struggle from the women‘s
movement, the law is changed and today the woman is considered as the joint natural
guardian of her children and also considered as the primary care taker of her
children. The courts also consider that she will be the best suited person to take care
of her children. In this section, women‘s right to custody and the ways in which this
right can be secured is explained.
a. Situations where custody of children becomes contentious
and precautions which women must take
What right do women, as mothers, have over their children?
A wife, along with her husband, has the right of custody and guardianship over her
children. As the primary care taker of her children, she is responsible for their care
and protection. Hence she is entitled to their custody and guardianship.
When does the issue of custody of children arise?
The issue of custody of children arises if due to a dispute between the spouses, if
either of the parties or both, wish to live separately from each other.
When she is separating from her husband, how can the woman retain the
custody of her children?
If she is separating from her husband, the best way to retain custody of the children
is for the wife to take the children along with her when she is leaving her
matrimonial home. If the children are already residing with the mother, usually
interim custody will be retained with the mother, even if the husband approaches the
court for custody of the children.
17
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
It is important for any one advising the woman (e.g. lawyer, NGO member,
counselor etc.) to give women accurate advise regarding this, to avoid unwarranted
anxiety about the issue of securing the legal custody of their children later during
court proceedings.
Why don‟t women usually take the children along with them?
This is because women think that if they take their children with them, the husband
may file a police complaint against them that they have kidnapped the children.
However, the police have no right to do this as she is the mother and hence she is
also the natural guardian of her children. A case of kidnapping cannot be filed
against a natural guardian.
Is it possible for the woman to take custody of her child after she has left the
home?
If a woman h*as not taken her children with her when she is leaving the house, it is
possible to take the custody later. This can be done with the help of a member of a
local Mahila Mandal / NGO, a social worker, or the local police, soon after she has
left the home. If the child left behind is very young and cannot live without the love
and care of the mother, or if the woman is breast feeding her child, this must be done
at the earliest. If there is a long gap after the woman has left the home, it will not be
possible to take custody in this manner, as the child may get used to living with the
father and his family and may not wish to come with the mother. In such a situation
it is advisable to approach the court for appropriate orders.
Caution: If the child is attached to the husband or his mother and does not wish to
come with the mother, it will not be possible to take the custody of the child. Always
remember that the child‘s wishes and wellbeing are the most important factors in
matters of custody.
Can the husband file a police complaint against her for kidnapping the child?
No, if the child wants to be with the mother and the mother wishes to have the child
with her, the husband cannot file a case of kidnapping against her as she is the
natural guardian of the child. However, only the mother alone has a right to take
custody of her child. No one else can do it on her behalf, but a support person or a
social worker can help her or accompany her. At times the police may refuse to help
the woman and may insist on a court order.
The Principle, the best interest of the child is paramount
18
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
What is the main principle which the courts rely upon while deciding the matter
of the custody of children?
The only principle which is applied while deciding the custody of children - the best
interest of the child is important. (This principle enshrined in the United Nations
Declaration of the Rights of the Child is relied upon by Indian Courts while
determining the parental rights for custody of children.) This means the custody must
be given to the person who is best suited to take care of the child or to the parent
who is the primary caretaker of the child. In the Indian setting, usually this person is
the mother.
What factors are considered by the court while deciding the „best interests of
the child‟?
The love and care given to the child is the most important factor. The general growth
of the child, the child‘s well-being, progress in school, child‘s own preference, the
atmosphere in the home - these are some of the factors which are considered while
deciding the ‗best interests of the child‘.
Generally, whoever has physical custody of the child at the point of approaching the
court usually gets to retain the custody. However, this rule is not rigid and if the
situation so demands, custody can be changed from one parent to the other, as per
the court order. Usually, if the child is older, while changing the custody, the court
will ascertain the views of the child.
Caution: If a woman is facing domestic violence and she is desirous of leaving her
matrimonial home to escape from violence, she must be given correct advice that she
has a right to take her children along with her, and that she does not require a court
order to do this.
Is it true that the law considers the father as the „natural guardian‟ of the
children and hence his right over the children as superior to that of the mother?
No this is not true. This was the belief earlier. Within the patriarchal family system,
the father was considered as the ‗head of the family‘ and the ‗natural guardian‘ of the
children. Both the wife and the children belonged to the husband; but gradually this
belief changed. Now our law considers both father and mother as equal partners in
marriage and also considers them as equal guardians of their children. The father‘s
rights over the child are not superior that of the mother. However, traditional values
still prevail and many people still endorse this anti women view and legally incorrect
view.
19
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
Is it true that the mother‟s rights over the custody of a child under five years is
superior to that of the father?
Yes, this is true. This is because a young child needs the love and care of the mother
and hence the law considers that the mother is better equipped to look after a child of
tender age. The child may also be breast fed by the mother. Depriving the child of
the mother‘s love and care may cause great trauma and anxiety to the child. In such
cases, if the mother is thrown out, the police can help the mother to get immediate
custody of the child, to save the child from being subjected to such trauma.
If the mother is employed, will she still be given custody of the child?
This is a general misconception that prevails in society. People feel that if the
woman is employed, she will not get custody of the child as she has no time to look
after the child and the father‘s mother may be more suitable to look after the child.
But this is not true. The right of the mother is superior to that of the husband‘s
mother. A woman will not be deprived of the custody of the child just because she is
working or has a demanding job.
If the father is very affluent and if the mother does not have sufficient means to
bring up the child, will she lose custody of the child?
Even if the father is very affluent, a mother will not be deprived of the custody of her
child only on this ground. It is usual in our society that the father has better financial
resources in most cases, and the woman may have been a housewife all her life. She
may not even have the requisite qualifications to earn an adequate income. But this
factor alone cannot be taken into consideration while deciding the issue of custody of
the child. The one who is able to provide the best love and care for the child will be
the only deciding factor. At times people feel that if the mother is unemployed she
may not get custody as she does not have the financial resources to bring up the
child. However, since the legal obligation to provide for the child is primarily with
the father, the fact that the mother does not have sufficient means to provide for the
child will not be considered as a major obstacle while awarding her the custody of
her child.
So, the bottom line is that it does not matter if the woman is employed or
unemployed.
If the husband accuses the wife of committing adultery, will she be entitled to
claim custody of her children?
Accusing the wife of adultery or of loose moral character is the usual ploy adopted
by the husband or his lawyer to deprive the wife of her right to custody of children
20
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
because they are under a misconception that a woman who has committed adultery
will not be entitled to custody of her children. But the factual position is that the
issue of custody of child will be decided only on who is the main care taker of the
child, what kind of environment the mother is able to provide for the well-being of
the child and not on whether she has committed any matrimonial fault. Since this
ploy is used routinely by lawyers, courts do not give it serious consideration.
However, many women get traumatized when they find that such baseless
allegations are leveled against them. It is best to ignore these allegations and focus
on the core issues regarding custody.
If the mother remarries after her divorce will she lose the custody of her child?
No, if she has been looking after the child well, she will not lose custody when she
remarries. When the court decides on the matter of custody, the court will look only
at the best interests of the child. The child‘s wishes will be taken into consideration.
If the child is happy with the mother, the mother will not be deprived of the custody
of her child upon her remarriage. Even the local (or caste) panchayat or the jamaat
cannot force the mother to give up the custody of her child upon her remarriage. If
this happens, she must not comply with the order, and instead immediately must file
an application for custody under the Domestic Violence Act and protect her rights.
Rights of a non-custodial Parent
If custody of the child is given to one parent, what right does the non-custodial
parent have?
It is important that the child has the love and care of both the parents. It is necessary
for the healthy upbringing of a child. Hence if one parent is given custody, the other
parent will be given the right of access. This means if the child is living with the
mother, the child may meet the father on a regular basis i.e. once a week, on a
Sunday or once a fortnight during the weekend, etc. Similarly during the holidays,
the father will be given some days to spend with the child. Sometimes the holidays
are divided equally between the parents. Usually the court issues strict guidelines
regarding the timings for access, which both parties must strictly comply with.
What care should the parents take so that the child grows up in a healthy
environment?
The parent who has custody of the child must look after the child‘s physical and
emotional needs well so that the child‘s personality develops well. The educational
needs of the child are also an important factor and the parent who has custody must
ensure that all educational needs of the child are met according to the standard of life
enjoyed by the parents.

6. Protection under the Domestic Violence Act
What is “domestic violence” under the Protection of Women from Domestic
Violence Act?
The term ―domestic violence‖ under Domestic Violence Act includes physical,
emotional, sexual and economic violence (S.3). The following is an explanation of
these terms.
Physical violence - beating, kicking, slapping, etc
Emotional violence – abusing, using derogative words, demanding dowry,
humiliating her because she does not have children or has only girl children, or
because she is not good looking or she has not brought enough dowry, etc or
threatening to throw her out of the house or threatening that she will not be provided
any money for her or her children‘s maintenance, etc.
Sexual violence forcing the wife to have sex when she is not in a position to have
sex (e.g. during menstruation or soon after delivery/ abortion), forcing her to watch
pornography, filming her nude and then circulating these video clips, threatening to
bring other women into the house to have sex with them in her presence, forcing the
wife to have sex with other men, etc.
Economic abuse means neglecting to maintain the wife, not giving her money for
her maintenance, throwing her out of the house and not providing any shelter or
maintenance, not retuning her dowry, stridhan or jewellery etc.
The husband has to pay for the woman‘s regular household expenses and for the
children‘s expenses. If he does not pay her regular maintenance or abandons the
wife, it would amount to domestic violence under this Act.
What rights does this Act give women?
The Act gives women the right to live a life free from violence. It protects the right
to shelter in the following ways :-
Right to an order of protection: If there is a threat of violence, the woman can get
an order of protection, restraining the husband and his family members from
committing violence on her. Even if she is living in her own father‘s house and if
she is afraid that the husband may assault her or come to her place of work and
22
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
humiliate her, she can ask for a ―stop order‖ (injunction) to restrain him from
coming anywhere near her (S.18).
Right to live in the same house: The husband, father-in-law or even the father of a
woman / girl cannot throw her out from the house where she is living or has lived
(S.19).
Right to claim Maintenance: As explained above, the woman has a right to claim
maintenance under this Act (S.20)
Right to custody: No one can take away the children from the mother, not even the
father. If such a threat is there, she can go to court and get an order to protect her
right. If her child is taken away forcibly from her custody she can approach the
police or the court to get her child back (S.21).
Right to claim compensation: If the woman has suffered any harm or injury due to
domestic violence she has a right to claim compensation for it under the Act (S.22).
Note: The woman has the right to take with her all her belongings i.e. clothes,
jewelry, valuables, money etc. This is her stridhan. She can take help to retrieve her
belongings from a local NGO, the police or the court. The remedy is also available
under S.19 (8) of the D.V.Act.
If her husband or in laws do not return her belongings (stridhan) at the time of
leaving the home, she can also file a police complaint under section 406 of the IPC.
Against whom can the woman get the orders under this Act?
A woman can get orders under this Act against her husband, father-in-law, brotherin- law etc. She can also get orders against the female relatives of the husband such
as mother-in-law or sister-in-law, if they have contributed to causing domestic
violence to the woman. Every woman can claim relief under this Act, irrespective of
their religion, including Muslims as the Act stipulates that any woman can claim
reliefs under this Act.
The Act defines the Aggrieved Person in very broad terms as ―Any woman/child
facing domestic violence from an adult male with whom she shares a domestic
relationship and is living/has lived within a shared household [S.2(a)].
Who should a woman approach to file a complaint?
The woman can approach the Protection Officer, a private lawyer, a legal aid lawyer
or a local NGO to help her in approaching the court to protect her rights. She can
23
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
also go to a police station and the police will refer her to the Protection Officer in
the area. If she is injured she can go to a hospital and the hospital will help her to
reach the police or the protection officer of the area.
What advice should be given to the woman before she files her complaint?
The woman must be advised that when she is leaving the house where she has lived
with her husband or in laws, she must take with her, her belongings and valuables,
her children, her documents such as her educational certificates, copy of other
documents such as birth or marriage certificate, caste certificate, husband‘s bank
pass book, or bank statement, contract of employment, etc.
Caution: The woman must collect evidence before leaving or filing the
complaint to support her statements. This could include medical reports of
injuries, earlier complaints to police, etc.
Also documents such as house papers to prove ownership of house, ration card, 7/12
extract as proof of land ownership or income from the land, any other proof to show
husband‘s income etc, are important to prove the husband‘s income.
Who is a „Protection Officer‟ under the Act?
A ‗Protection Officer‘ (PO) is a government officer designated or appointed by the
Ministry of Women and Child Development, who is entrusted with the duty of
providing all kinds of support to the woman including helping her to approach the
court, taking her to a shelter home if she needs shelter, taking her to a hospital if she
needs medical help or helping her to access other government schemes to help
women.
The total number of Protection Officers in Maharashtra are around 670. This
number includes the officers who are designated as Protection Officers as well as
those specially appointed as Protection Officers.
How to approach a court for an order?
Each time a woman is beaten and she approaches the Protection Officer, a Domestic
Incident Report (DIR-Form I) is prepared. This provides a proof of domestic
violence.
If the woman has gone directly to a private lawyer, then the lawyer will prepare a
detailed application and also an application for interim reliefs. In such case there is
no need to approach a protection officer and obtain a DIR.
24
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
If she has any evidence then that can also be mentioned (for instance if earlier a
police complaint was filed by her or if she has gone to the hospital when she was
injured due to the beating, etc.) All proofs of husband‘s income can be attached if
the woman is seeking an order of maintenance under the DV Act.
In the end, it must be clearly stated as to what type of remedies she is seeking (e.g.
protection, maintenance, residence, custody of child, etc.)
How long will it take to obtain an Order?
This Act is supposed to provide quick reliefs. The court dates are given at short
intervals. It is possible to get an interim order within a month of filing the
proceedings. Though the final orders are supposed to be given within 60 days, due
to technical difficulties and workload of the court, this does not usually happen. But
the final order can be expected within one year of filing and an interim order can be
expected at least within two months.

III. Violence Against Women & Children
7. Dowry Harassment and Cruelty Against Wives
What is the meaning of Dowry?
Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act (DPA), 1961 defines ―dowry‖ as any cash,
jewelry, valuables, or property which the husband or his family members demand
from the bride‘s parents at the time of marriage, as a consideration of marriage. This
term also includes demands made subsequent to the marriage from the bride or her
parents.
Is demanding dowry an offence?
Yes, it is a serious offence under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. It is punishable
with a minimum of five years‘ imprisonment and a fine of Rs.15, 000/- or equal to
the value of the dowry demanded or paid.
Who can register a complaint under this Act?
The woman herself, her parents, the police, Dowry Prohibition Officer appointed
under S.8-B of the Act, or even a non-governmental organization on behalf of the
woman, can register a complaint.
Which are the Provisions Related to Dowry Related Violence in the
Indian Penal Code (IPC)?
After the anti-dowry in early 1980 several women‘s organisations demanded
stringent punishment for husbands and their family members if they caused any
dowry related violence to a newly married bride. If a woman died in her matrimonial
home within seven years under unnatural or suspicious circumstanced, a special
legal provision was incorporated which is termed as S.304B – Dowry Death. If a
26
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
woman committed suicide due to harassment for dowry within seven years of her
marriage, S.306 of IPC-Abetment to Suicide can be invoked. If the woman was
harassed for dowry or was treated with cruelty, S.498A can be invoked. In this case,
there is no limitation of seven years after marriage. If her stridhan is not returned to
her, S.406 can be invoked, along with S.498A. The following table indicates the
punishment that can be awarded under these sections.

Despite widespread campaigns against dowry and the stringent
laws, why has the menace grown?
In our society the social status awarded to the girl‘s family is much lower than that
awarded to the groom‘s family. Since the need to get the daughters married is
overwhelming, the bride‘s family is not able to refuse the demand for dowry at the
time of marriage. They fear that if they don‘t give dowry, their daughters won‘t get
married. So the parents of the bride prefer to meet the demands of the groom‘s
family in order to get their daughters married, as having an unmarried daughter at
home is considered a social stigma.
What is the remedy?
The problem is not with the gifts which are given to the bride from her parents or
from her husband‘s family. The problem is that the woman does not have control
27
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
over these items and they area considered as the property of the husband and his
family. This attitude must be changed. Girls must be advised that the gifts given at
the time of marriage are her exclusive property and if she has been forced to leave
the matrimonial home due to domestic violence, she has a right to take these with
her.
What precautionary measures must be taken at the time of
marriage?
The girl‘s parents must take the following precautions at the time of their daughter‘s
marriage to secure her future:
 The girl and her family members must refuse the marriage proposal from a
groom or his family members if they make demands for dowry at the time of
marriage negotiations.
 The parents are free to give gifts to their daughter at the time of marriage out of
love and affection for her. The gifts given by relatives, friends and even by the
husband or his relatives belong exclusively to the bride, and constitutes her
stridhan. A list of these gifts received at the time of marriage must be made and
the bride, the groom and their parents must sign this document and it must be
kept safely with the girl‘s family or a trusted friend, so that there is no dispute
regarding the gifts received as stridhan later.
 If after the marriage is arranged, valuables or cash is demanded as dowry or
gifts, the marriage preparations must be stopped and a complaint under the
Dowry Prohibition Act must be immediately be registered. (See the later section
regarding property rights of women for a further discussion on this issue.)
 Rather than cash gifts, relatives must be encouraged to give cheques in favour of
the girl at the time of marriage and this should be deposited either in her own
separate account or in a joint account in the name of the bride and the groom.
 All valuables and jewelry which belongs to the bride must be kept in a locker
which is in her exclusive name or which is in the joint names of herself and the
groom, which she has the right to operate.
28
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
 If after marriage the girl is harassed for more dowry, she must communicate this
to her parents through letters or emails. The parents of the girl may meet the
groom and his family members to sort out the differences and if they cannot be
resolved, the girl must be given a choice to return to her parents‘ home.
 In the event that the bride is thrown out of her matrimonial home, she must take
with her all her jewelry and valuables.
 In case this is not possible, at the time of leaving or soon thereafter, she must
lodge a complaint to the police mentioning the fact of harassment for dowry and
also give the police a list of valuables that are left behind in the husband‘s
home. The police can register a case under the Dowry Prohibition Act as well as
under S.498A and S.406 of IPC and help the girl to immediately retrieve her
belongings and valuables from the husband‘s residence. (These IPC provisions
are discussed later in this section.)
 If at this stage no compromise is possible the girl can also initiate proceedings
under the Domestic Violence Act for her civil rights such as maintenance,
residence, return of belongings etc.
What is Stridhan?
The gifts given to the bride out of love and affection by her parents or relatives
constitute her stridhan. The gifts given to the bride by her husband and/or his
relatives also constitute her stridhan. The term ―Stridhan‖ means a woman‘s
property and she has exclusive control over it. Even if it is kept with her husband or
his parents, when a woman demands it, it must be given back to her.
How can a woman claim her Stridhan if it is in the possession of her
husband or in-laws?
In many families, the stridhan property is kept in the custody of the mother-in-law
or the husband. If they refuse to give it back to her, when she demands, or when she
is leaving the matrimonial home, it is an offence under S.406 of IPC - Criminal
Misappropriation of Trust. If the woman lodges a complaint with the police, the
29
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
police will immediately call the husband / his family members to the police station
and request them to return the jewelry and valuables. If they refuse, the police will
file a case under S.406 of IPC and arrest them and also get an order to search and
seize the valuables from the premises or bank lockers etc.
Criminal complaint against husband and/or in-laws for causing
cruelty
What is cruelty to a wife under the Criminal Law?
Section 498A of IPC defines cruelty as follows: If a husband or his relatives, harass
a woman for dowry, or cause any physical or mental harassment which causes harm
to her life, limb or sanity, it amounts to cruelty.
Is it a serious offence?
Yes. It is a serious offence. Though the maximum punishment is only three years,
the offence is cognizable, non-bailable and non-compoundable. The police have the
power of immediate arrest, even without a court warrant. This causes a great deal of
humiliation to the husband and his family members. Once filed, the complaint cannot
be withdrawn easily. It can only be quashed by the High Court. Once a complaint
under this section is filed, it is difficult to reconcile the marriage.
Can this section be used to address general physical and mental
cruelty inflicted on a married woman?
Yes. This section can be used for dowry related harassment as well as for any
physical or emotional harassment caused to the wife as it can be seen from the
definition of this provision.
Section 498-A: Husband or relatives of husband of a woman subject her to
cruelty. - ‗Whoever, being husband or the relative of the husband of a woman,
30
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
subjects such women to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term
which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation - for the purpose of this section ‗Cruelty‘ means
(a) any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to
commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or heath, whether
mental or physical of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her
or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or
valuable security or in on account of failure by her or any person related to her to
meet such a demand.
What are the problems faced by women to register cases under this
Section?
Usually the police refuse to register cases under this section unless specific
allegations of dowry demands are included in the complaint. But now slowly this
misconception is changing. But even now, the police do not register the case straight
away. The couple is first sent for counseling, and the police only registers the
complaint if the dispute is not resolved.
How can cruelty be proved?
Cruelty can be proved in various ways such as complaints to the police, medical
records, letters written to her parents by the girl, phone calls, phone messages,
statements of friends or neighbours, etc.
Is forced sex in marriage (marital rape) within the purview of this
section?
31
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
Yes, forced sex amounts to sexual violence and is included within the term,
―cruelty‖. So forced sex will come within the purview of this section and if there are
any such complaints of this nature, the police must immediately file the complaint
and arrest the husband. (Though S.498A does not specifically define sexual violence
as cruelty, but uses broader general term as 'any physical or mental harassment
which causes harm to her life, limb or sanity', rape / sexual violence would come
within its scope.)
8. Rape & Sexual Offences Under IPC
(As Amended by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013)
Mathura, the Catalyst of the anti-rape campaign in India
Mathura, a 16-year-old poor, orphan, illiterate tribal girl, was raped by two
policemen within a police compound in Desai Ganj, a small village in Chandrapur
District of Maharashtra. She was brought to the police station in the evening of 26
March 1972, on a complaint filed by her own brother that she had eloped with her
lover. At 10.00 pm at night, while her relatives were waiting outside, after the
interrogation, two policemen on duty, Tukaram and Ganpat, took her to a toilet
within the compound of the police station and raped her. When the relatives called
out to her, she came out in a distorted state with a torn saree and informed them that
the policemen had raped her. Hearing the commotion, people gathered and due to
their pressure a case of rape was registered. The medical report revealed that there
were no marks of injury on her body and that the vagina admitted two fingers easily,
which implied that she was ‗habituated to sexual intercourse‘. Her age was stated as
being between 14 and 16 years.
The sessions judge, Chandrapur, on 1 June, 1974 acquitted the policemen on the
ground that since there were no marks of injury, Mathura must have consented. He
labeled her a ―shocking liar‖ whose evidence was ―filled with falsehood‖. The judge
concluded that though sexual intercourse with the policemen was proved, there was a
‗world of difference between ―sexual intercourse and rape‖.
In appeal, based on the same evidence, the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court
reversed the judgment and convicted the accused to rigorous imprisonment for five
32
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
years and held that ―passive or helpless surrender induced by threats or fear cannot
be equated with ‗free consent‖. However, in appeal, the Supreme Court, in
September, 1978, reversed this judgment, upheld the judgment of the Sessions Court
and acquitted the accused on the ground that absence of injuries implies consent.
The judgment shocked some law teachers, who wrote an open letter to the Chief
Justice of India condemning it as they felt it would ―snuff out all hopes of justice for
millions of Mathura‘s in the country‖ in 1979. This open letter gave birth to the antirape campaign in India and resulted in amendments to the rape laws in 1983.
An important aspect of the amendment was that custodial rape (rape in police
custody, prisons, etc.) was made into an aggravated form of sexual crime warranting
severe punishment of a minimum of 10 years. The Supreme Court ruling had
highlighted the fact that in a rape trial it is extremely difficult for a woman to prove
that she did not consent ―beyond all reasonable doubt‖ as was required under the
criminal law. The major demand of the campaign was that the onus of proving
consent should shift from the prosecution to be accused. Accordingly, the ―burden
of proof‖ regarding consent was shifted for cases of custodial rape. Since then there
have also been several changes in criminal procedures, police manuals, etc. which
have given strict guidelines that women cannot be arrested at night and that they
cannot be retained in police custody at night. But the stringent provisions did not
have the desired impact of reducing the incidents of rape in the country as the
following graph reveals.

Addressing Biases, Clearing Misconceptions and
Understanding Precautionary Measures
“It is not your fault” In our society, if a woman or child is raped, she is
treated as an accused and made to suffer. She is made to feel that it is her own
fault that she got raped. Her character, conduct, the way she dresses, her past
sexual history, etc. become suspect and she is blamed for the crime that is
committed on her. Due to the stigma attached to rape, the family is afraid of
reporting it to the police. There is also the fear that reporting the crime will
diminish the chances of the girl getting married and that the entire family will
be humiliated and ostracized. This is all the more true if the girl is poor or
from a backward caste. Hence as change agents it is important for us to spread
the message that it is not the fault of the victim that she is raped.
If we are aware of our rights, understand the procedures and take precautions,
the trauma faced by a victim / survivor during investigation and trial of a rape
case will be reduced.
Preserve all evidence: As far as possible, the victim should not have a bath
or wash herself or wash the clothes that she was wearing at the time of the
offence. It is very difficult to do this because the natural instinct after rape is
38
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
to clean one‘s self and also wash the clothes to wipe out the feeling of
violation that the offence of rape brings about. The place where the crime was
committed also must not be disturbed. This is important to collect the
evidence to prove rape.
Do not delay filing the FIR: Due to the stigma attached to the offence, the
family takes time to consider whether to report the offence to the police or to
hush up the matter. There are several levels of consultations take place within
the family and even at the community level. The social status of the rapists or
his connection with authorities also matter. If the rapist is wealthy, or has high
social standing, and the victim is from a poor family, there will be a great
reluctance to report the crime. Similarly if he is a relative or a neighbor, there
will be reluctance. Due to this sometimes cases are filed even after many days.
Caution: Delay in filing the complaint will result in loss of crucial evidence
and due to this it may be difficult to prove the case in court later.
.
Go to a hospital directly and start treatment: Instead of going to the police
station, the victim can to directly to the hospital and get immediate medical
treatment. This will help not only to preserve crucial evidence against the
accused but avert any infectious or dangerous disease and avert pregnancy.
Parents, relatives, friends, social workers etc may accompany the victim for
the medical examination. The FIR can be lodged from the hospital itself.
Anyone can get raped. It can happen anywhere – There is a general belief
that rape is committed only by strangers in lonely places and dark corners. But
the statistics for Maharashtra for 2012 reveal that 94% of the reported cases
are by known persons. Fathers, step fathers, uncles, grandfathers, brothers,
brother-in-law, other relatives, neighbors, teachers, doctors, police,
boyfriends, his friends, etc. are known to commit rape. [Even husbands
commit rape, but this does not get recorded as rape, but it can be filed as an
offence under S.498-A IPC - cruelty to wives – discussed later in the next
session.]
All rapes are not violent specially those committed by known persons
Many times the fact that a young girl is raped is detected only when she is
about 5-6 months pregnant. When she approaches the hospital to find out why
she has missed her menstrual period, the fact that the child is raped is
detected. So be alert.

Penetration by Penis into vagina is not important to prove rape: After the
recent amendment to rape laws, it is not important to prove penetration of the
penis into the vagina. All other sexual activity such as inserting fingers, or
objects such as rods, sticks etc. into the vagina, anus or inserting penis into
anus or mouth (oral sex) also constitutes rape. (The legal definitions are
discussed in detail later)
The Victim need not go to the Police Station to lodge FIR, a relative,
friend or social worker can lodge it: The victim may be traumatized after
the rape or she may be injured or she may be very scared to go to the police
station and narrate the incident to the police.
Remember – there is no need for a victim to go to a police station personally
to lodge the FIR. It can be lodged by any person on her behalf. This is the
law and you must insist that the police will follow this and not force the victim
to come to the police station to lodge the FIR if she is reluctant to do so
Her statement can be recorded later at her home or any other place where she
is comfortable.
Creating Awareness about Sexual Offences: The new amendment to rape
laws have listed out many types of sexual offences and mentioned different
body parts. We must also familiarize ourselves with pronouncing the names
sexual organs such as i.e. breasts, vagina, buttocks, thighs, anus, penis etc..
We usually feel embarrassed to utter these words and there is a cultural barrier
against naming sexual organs. But under the new law it is very important to
describe the offence accurately by naming the concerned body part while
recording an FIR. We cannot use general terms such as izzat loota or galat
kaam kiya.
We should also teach our children to be aware of their body parts, and how to
protect themselves against sexual abuse and give confidence to them to report
it to their care takers (teachers, parents, etc.) when they are sexually abused.
Only then will the stigma attached to rape will be reduced.
Respect the sexual choices made by young women: Many times when a
young girl has an affair with a boy and the parents do not approve of it, the
girl runs away with the boy. Although the parents are aware that the girl has
gone with her own choice, they file a complaint against the boy for
kidnapping and rape and get him arrested. When the girl is brought back she is
40
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
pressurized into accepting the wishes of the parents and agrees to marry the
boy of her choice. Sometimes the girl refuses to accept the choice of their
parents and insists on marrying the boy of her own choice and prefers to stay
at a shelter home until she becomes major and is able to marry the boy. Such
cases tend to get categorized as ―false cases‖ through no fault of the girl and
due to this all girls become suspect when they wish to file a case of rape. So
avoid filing such cases. This defeats the purpose for which we are all fighting
- to protect the dignity of women.
A scheme for financial assistance and other support to Rape Victims:
Recently the National Legal Services Authority has drafted a comprehensive
scheme for compensation to rape survivors. All state governments are bound
to adopt the scheme drafted by Central Government
Support to Victims during Investigation and Trial: After recent
amendments, a government official can be designated as a support person to
help the victim during the procedures of investigation and trial. This person
can be a government officer from the department of Women and Child
Development or an NGO member working with the government. The victim
can also have her own lawyer. If she has no financial resources, she can ask
the state to provide her a lawyer from the legal aid panel.
9. Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,
2012
(POCSO)
In 2012 a special law was passed to provide protection to children who are victims of
sexual abuse. This acts additional safeguard to the child during the criminal trial and
provides for protection and rehabilitation of the victim. This Act protects both male
and female children who are under 18 years of age. Similarly, any adult, male or a
female can be the accused person under this Act. The Act provides a wide definition
of sexual abuse and non-vaginal penetration and insertion of objects into the mouth,
vagina, anus or urethra of the child amounts to sexual abuse under the Act. This
Act does not use the word ‗rape‘ to describe sexual violence.

IV. WOMEN‟S HEALTH AND SAFETY
10. MEDICAL TERMINATION OF
PREGNANCY ACT
Background of the Act
The MTP Act, passed by Parliament in 1971to permit legalized abortions. Prior to
1971, abortion was criminalized under Section 312 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860,
except in cases where the procedure was necessary to save the woman‘s life. The
Shah Committee, appointed by the Government of India, carried out a
comprehensive review of socio-cultural, legal and medical aspects of abortion, and
in 1966 recommended legalizing abortion to protect women‘s health and lives on
both compassionate and medical grounds. It was also viewed as a population control
measure. The term ―Medical Termination of Pregnancy‖ (MTP) was used to counter
opposition from socio-religious groups who were averse to abortion.
How are women‟s reproductive rights protected?
Women‘s reproductive rights are protected under the Constitution. The right to live
under Article 21 include the right to live in dignity which is inclusive of women‘s
reproductive rights (i.e. the right to become pregnant, to bear children, to decide the
number of children, the right to have an abortion, to use or not use contraceptives, to
be or not to be sterilized, to be or not to be a parent, etc.). A mother‘s right to
preserve her own health is superior to the right of an unborn child.
Do women in India have a right to a legal abortion?
Yes women in India do have the right to legal abortion. In many countries women
had to struggle very hard to get this right. But in India, a law was passed in 1971,
the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act to secure for women the right to
have legal and safe abortions in public hospitals. This was done to curb the practice
of illegal abortions which were carried on rampantly by non-medical professionals at
a great risk to women‘s health.
46
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
What is an abortion?
Abortion is a medical procedure of removing the foetus from the uterus of a woman
who is pregnant if she wishes not to have the child. This procedure must be carried
out only by registered medical practitioners who are authorized to do it under the
MTP Act and if not done in a proper condition it poses a risk to the woman‘s life.
What are the conditions under which a pregnancy can be
terminated?
Pregnancy can be terminated in the first trimester (within 12 weeks) if a doctor is of
the opinion that it is safe for the woman to undergo an abortion. Beyond 12 weeks
and up to 20 weeks, the opinion of two doctors is required to perform the abortion.
Beyond that a pregnancy cannot be terminated as it is very risky and may cause harm
or even death to the pregnant mother. Hence it can be performed only in an extreme
situation when it is necessary to abort the foetus to save the life of the mother. [S.3
(2) (a and b)]
While deciding whether or not to perform the abortion, the doctors must ascertain the
risk of harm to the health of the pregnant mother. The doctors‘ permission to
perform the abortion must be recorded in writing.
Whose consent is required for terminating pregnancy?
If the woman is a major, i.e. above 18 years, she can consent to the abortion herself.
If it is a child below 18 years or the person is incapable of giving valid consent (if

No, the doctors or the hospital authority cannot disclose to the public any
information about the woman who undergoes termination of her pregnancy. This
information has to be kept confidential. [S.7 (1) (c)]
11. Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic
Techniques (Regulation) Act (PCPNDT) 1994
Why is the female foetus aborted in our society?
Indian society carries within it a tradition of male preference. The great urge to have
boys coupled with a high cost of living has led to a rise in sex-selective abortions.
Unfortunately, provisions of the MTP Act are frequently abused in that many
families invoke the Act to help them in carrying out abortions of female fetuses after
conducting tests to determine the sex of the child using modern technology such as
sonography. The age old preference to have sons received a new boost due to this
and gradually resulted in a skewed sex ratio.
This Act was amended in 2002 and even pre-conception techniques used / advertised
to select the sex of the foetus even before conception was banned.
What has the government done to curb this trend?
In order to curb this trend, in 1994, Government passed a new law, known as the Pre
Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of
Misuse) Act, 1994 (PCPNDT Act for short). Since these tests are important to detect
foetal abnormalities and genetic defects the tests could not be banned, they could
only be regulated. Now the tests can be done only under very strict conditions and
they cannot be used for the purpose of identifying and disclosing the sex of the
unborn foetus.
48
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
In order to curb the practice, it has now become necessary to register all sonography
machines and also necessary to display very clearly that the hospital or the clinic
does not disclose the sex of the unborn foetus.
What is the punishment for misusing the provisions of this Act?
Performing such tests is punishable by upto 3 years of imprisonment and a fine of
upto Rs.10,000/- for the first offence and upto five years of imprisonment and a fine
of upto Rs.50,000/- for the subsequent offence. Any doctor doing such a test is also
liable to have his license for medical practice suspended for two years for the first
offence and permanently after the second offence. (S.23).
Monitoring of Genetic Counseling Centres
The PCPNDT Act provides for regulation of genetic counseling centers, genetic
laboratories and genetic clinics and also regulates pre-natal diagnostic procedures.
The medical professional running the genetic center has to be registered under the
PCPNDT Act.
1 It allows the use of prenatal diagnostic techniques for the purpose of specific
genetic abnormalities or disorders only and to put down a prohibition on the use of
these techniques for determining the sex of the fetus by any such person under the
Act.
2 The Act also prohibits any kind of advertisements on pre-conception and pre-natal
sex determination of fetus or sex selection of fetus is prohibited. The Act provides
for three years imprisonment and fine up to ten thousand rupees as punishment in
contravention of the Act

V. Women‟s Rights under Labour Laws
Introduction
The Constitution of India mandates that women must be treated as equals and
prohibits any discrimination against women in all areas, including education,
vocational training, skill development and employment. In order to ensure that
women get a fair and adequate opportunity of employment, the constitution also
mandates reservation for women in educational institutions and in employment in the
public sector.
Our Constitution also protects the rights of women workers by ensuring that their
health and safety is duly protected in the course of employment, particularly those of
pregnant women and breast feeding mothers. The Constitution also safeguards the
dignity of women workers and ensures that they are provided a safe working
environment free of sexual harassment.
In order to fulfill the Constitutional mandate all labour laws contain special
provisions regarding the health and safety of women workers by regulating their
working hours and by reducing the burden women have to carry. In order to ensure
equality the law also mandates that both men and women will be paid the same
wages for the same or similar type of work. Recently, a special law has been
enacted to protect women against sexual harassment at the workplace. The rights of
women under different labour laws are discussed in this section.
a. Special Protection to Women under the Labour Laws
What are the special laws which are enacted to provide adequate protection to
women workers?
The following laws are specially enacted to provide further protection to women
workers:-
53
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
 The Equal Remuneration Act;
 The Maternity Benefits Act; and
 The Protection of women from Sexual Harassment Act.
(Also included is the Minimum Wages Act)
They are applicable only to women and have been enacted to provide special
protection and safety for the special needs of women.
Does enacting special law for women amount to discrimination?
No, enacting special laws for women does not amount to ―discrimination‖.
The power to enact special laws for women is given to the legislature under Article
15 (3) of the Constitution which stipulates that providing for additional safeguards to
women is not discriminatory but will enhance the principle of equality, as it will
help women to overcome the wrongs they have suffered for centuries.
12. Equal Remuneration Act, 1976
How does the Equal Remuneration Act safeguard women‟s Rights?
Under the provisions of this Act, every employer is under a legal obligation to pay
the same wages for men and women if they perform the same work or work of a
similar nature. Even if it is being performed at different places, the salary has to be
the same. An employer cannot discriminate against women while recruiting unless
employment of women is prohibited or restricted by law. Thus, in matters of
recruitment, promotions, training and transfer, the employer is prohibited from
discriminating against women.
54
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
Who is responsible for ensuring that the provisions of the Act are strictly
followed?
The responsibility of ensuring that the provisions of the Act are strictly followed and
also that there is no discrimination between men and women in the sphere of
recruitment, promotions and training lies with the employer. It is also the
responsibility of the employer to maintain proper registers, documents or muster
rolls, etc. which can be scrutinized by the labour officer of the district. Any woman
who faces discrimination in these aspects can file a complaint before the labour
officer of her area.
13. Maternity Benefits Act 1961
Background of the Act
A maternity benefit Act stipulates that every woman shall be entitled to, and her
employer shall be liable for, the payment of maternity benefit, which is the amount
payable to her at the daily wage rate for the period of her actual absence. There is
need for maternity benefits so that a woman is to be able to give quality time to her
child without having to worry about whether she will lose her job and her source of
income.
This Act was enacted on 12th December 1961, to regulate the employment of women
in certain establishment for certain period before and after child-birth and to provide
for maternity benefit and certain other benefits.
Why maternity leave is important for any women employee?
Women‘s ties with pregnancy and child rearing and the failure of employers and
policymakers to deal consistently with this issue exacerbate the difficulties women
face in the economy. Women continue to have the primary responsibility for
housework and childcare, even when they have extremely demanding jobs. Few
55
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
employers provide help with childcare, flexible work hours to accommodate
children‘s needs, or paid maternity leaves. Women in blue-collar work as well as
clerical jobs face rigid time schedules, low pay, and virtually no recognition or help
from employers for their family responsibilities
Which all establishments are included by government?
All the establishments are included by government which is under government
authority or not. The benefit of the act is provided to all establishment be it mining,
plantation and factory. This establishment also includes all the persons are
employed for the exhibition of equestrian, acrobatics and other performances.
How are the leave provided under this act?
Maternity benefit Act 1961
Leave 26 weeks not more than 8 weeks
Remuneration
Average daily wage shall be paid for the period of her actual absence
immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six
weeks immediately following that day.
Additional
Benefits
(i)Medical Bonus – 3,500 Rupees if no pre-natal confinement and postnatal care is provided for by the employer free of charge;
(ii) Nursing Breaks; Crèche Facilities; and
(iii) Four visits a day to the crèche, including the interval for rest.

Does the act apply to miscarriage and mother adopting a child also?
In case of miscarriage, a woman shall, on production of such proof as may be
prescribed, be entitled to leave with wages at the rate of maternity benefit for a
period of six weeks immediately following the day of her miscarriage.
In case of the mother adopting child below age of three months shall be provided
with leave of 12 weeks.
Can any employer dismiss the employ during her leave for pregnancy or deny
working from home?
Where a woman absents herself from work in accordance with the provisions of this
Act, it shall be unlawful for her employer to discharge or dismiss her during or on
account of such absence or to give notice of discharge or dismissal on such a day that
the notice will expire during such absence, or to vary to her disadvantage any of the
conditions of her service.
Also with latest amendments a women is allowed to work from home if nature of
work is such where women and employee agree on her condition working from
home.
14. Sexual Harassment at Work Place (Prevention,
Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013
The Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act of 2013 is a special Legislation aiming
towards providing a safe and hostile free environment at work to women.
 An effective implementation of the Act will contribute to the realization of
their right to gender equality, life and liberty, equality in working conditions
everywhere.
 The sense of security at the workplace will improve women‘s participation in
work, resulting in their economic empowerment and inclusive growth.

 The Act is gender specific to only women.
EVOLUTION :
 Bhanwari Devi, a social worker from Rajasthan, During her work, she
prevented the marriage of a one year girl in the community. The issue was
reported to the local complaints committee and no action was taken.
Bhanwari Devi was however subsequently gangraped by those are men.
 Vishaka Judgement and SC Guidelines: In the absence of a specific law in
India, the Supreme Court, in the Vishaka Judgment, laid down certain
guidelines making it mandatory for every employer to provide a mechanism
to redress grievances pertaining to workplace sexual harassment.
 Who is it Applicable to?
It Extends to the whole of India. It applies to both the Organised and
unorganized sectors in India.
 What constitutes “Sexual harassment”?
As per the POSH Act, ‗sexual harassment‘ includes unwelcome sexually
tinted behaviour, whether directly or by implication, such as (i) physical
contact and advances, (ii) demand or request for sexual favours, (iii) making
sexually coloured remarks, (iv) showing pornography, or (v) any other
unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature.
Dr. Punita K. Sodhi v. Union of India & Ors. W.P. (C) 367/2009 & CMS
828, 11426/2009
In 2010, the High Court of Delhi upheld the view that sexual harassment is a
subjective experience and for that reason held ―A complete understanding of
the complainant‘s view requires... an analysis of the different perspectives of
men and women. Conduct that many men consider unobjectionable may
offend many women... Men tend to view some forms of sexual harassment as
―harmless social interactions to which only overly-sensitive women would
object. The characteristically male view depicts sexual harassment as
58
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
comparatively harmless amusement.... Men, who are rarely victims of sexual
assault, may view sexual conduct in a vacuum without a full appreciation of
the social setting or the underlying threat of violence that a woman may
perceive.‖
 How to Identify “WORKPLACE”?
Work place has to be understood in a wider connotation and not looked in a
pedantic approach. In
Saurabh Kumar Mallick v. Comptroller & Auditor General of India, The
word ― Work place‖ has been objectively defined. The test laid down
includes 1)Proximity from the place of work; 2)Control of the management
over such a place/residence where the working woman is residing; and 3)
Such a residence has to be an extension or contiguous part of the working
place.
 What are my Reliefs?
The Complainant has the option to file a written complaint to ICC/LCC.
Either she can demand an enquiry into the matter or choose to conciliate. In
case of the former, the Complaints committee has to conduct a detailed
investigation within the workplace and declare their judgement along with
the recommendations to the employer.
The Complaints Committee has the discretion to suggest the penalties after
having heard both the parties.
Any aggrieved Party also has a right to appeal against the order of the
ICC/LCC for further reliefs under this Act.
 Where should the complaint be filed?
An important feature of the POSH Act is that it envisages the setting up of a
grievance redressal forum.
INTERNAL COMPLAINTS COMMITTEE – ORGANISED SECTOR
59
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
The POSH Act requires an employer to set up an ‗internal complaints
committee‘ (―ICC‖) at each office or branch, of an organization employing
10 or more employees, to hear and redress grievances pertaining to sexual

LOCAL COMPLAINTS COMMITTEE - UNORGANISED SECTOR.
At the district level, the Government is required to set up a ‗local complaints

harassment from the unorganized sector or from establishments where the
ICC has not been constituted on account of the establishment having less than
10 employees or if the complaint is against the employer.

15. Minimum Wages Act 1948
Background of The Act:
The Indian Constitution has defined a 'living wage' that is the level of income for a
worker which will ensure a basic standard of living including good health, dignity,
comfort, education and provide for any contingency. However, to keep in mind an
industry's capacity to pay the constitution has defined a 'fair wage'.[1] Fair wage is
that level of wage that not just maintains a level of employment, but seeks to
increase it keeping in perspective the industry‘s capacity to pay.
What age group people are allowed to work under labor law?
The ―adolescent‖ means a person who has completed his/her fourteenth year of age
but has not completed eighteenth year and ―adult‖ means a person who has
completed eighteen years.
What minimum wages have to be paid?
(1) Any minimum rate of wages fixed or revised by the appropriate Government
in respect of scheduled employments under section 3 may consist of-
61
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
(i) a basic rate of wages and a special allowance at a rate to be adjusted, at such
intervals and in such manner as the appropriate Government may direct, to accord as
nearly as practicable with the variation in the cost of living index number applicable
to such workers (hereinafter referred to as the ―cost of living allowance‖); or
(ii) a basic rate of wages with or without the cost of living allowance and the
cash value of the concessions in respect of supplies of essential commodities at
concessional rates, where so authorized; or
(iii) An all-inclusive rate allowing for the basic rate, the cost of living allowance
and the cash value of the concessions, if any.
How does government revise the wages and circulate the same detail?
The government would revise the wages and circulate in the following manner:
(a) appoint as many committees and sub-committees as it considers necessary to hold
enquiries and advise it in respect of such fixation or revision, as the case may be, or
(b) By notification in the Official Gazette, publish its proposals for the information
of persons likely to be affected thereby and specify a date, not less than two months
from the date of the notification, on which the proposals will be taken into
consideration.
What punishments can be imposed upon the employer who has not followed the
law under the said act?
Any employer who— (a) Pays to any employee less than the minimum rates of
wages fixed for that employee's class of work, or less than the amount due to him
under the provisions of this Act or (b) Contravenes any rule or order made under
section 13 shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six
months or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees or with both:

VI. OTHER ACTS
16. The Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act
What is the objective of this Act?
It was enacted to prevent the commission of offences of atrocities against the
members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes and to provide for Special Courts for the
trial of such offences and for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of such
offenses.
The Act Protects the Marginalized Communities against discrimination and
atrocities. For example footwear garlands, parading them naked, dumping garbage at
premises owned by SC/ST. Further it also provides rehabilitation to the victims of
such offences and discrimination by providing an equal opportunity in the field of
education and employment.
Who can file a complaint?
Any scheduled caste or scheduled tribe who is identified accordingly under the law.
He/She should be aggrieved and experienced physical. Mental, psychological,
emotional or monetary harm or harm to his property as a result of the commission of
any discrimination or atrocities. Any relative, legal guardian and legal heirs of the
victim are also protected under the law.
What reliefs can be sought?
He /She can be protected from social disabilities such as denial of
 access to certain public places,
 to use the customary passage without being boycotted,
 personal atrocities like forceful drinking or eating of inedible food,
 sexual exploitation of SC/ST,
63
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
 Bodily injury etc.
 One can also be protected from atrocities affecting the properties, malicious
prosecution, political disabilities and economic exploitation.
Where can they file a complaint?
The SC and ST Act, 1989, empowers the state government to set up special courts
and exclusive special courts in every district to dispose off within 2 months or as
far as possible from the date of filing chargesheet. The Act also provides a right to
appeal in case of being aggrieved by the order of the Special court and Exclusive
Special Court. The State government also is empowered to ensure effective
implementation of the Act.
 Protection of witnesses and victims The SC and ST Act, 1989 has laid down
all the rights of the victims and witnesses, in order to curb such violence. It
also aims at encouraging its reporting for fair and just implementation of law.
 Crimes Against SC and ST : Violence against SC/ST is very nuanced in
nature, so it is difficult to separate atrocities against SC/ST from law and order
problems. So in many instances, the case is registered under IPC or CrPC than
PoA
Atrocities are in various forms such as cow vigilantism (most dalits are in the
occupation of leather making hides of the cow), honour killing, social boycott (Khap
Panchayat), caste clashes, discrimination in Universities (Rohit Vemula case).
Though the SC ST Prevention of Atrocities Act is very stringent, most cases end in
acquittal due to police lethargy and due to destruction of evidence of the crime. Also
eye witnesses do not come forward to testify against powerful upper caste men.
Examples of Atrocities in Independent India
 Kizhavenmani, Tamil Nadu (1958) in which 44 SCs were burnt to death in a
confined building because SC agricultural labourers sought a little raise in their
very low wages. The high court acquitted all the accused.
64
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
 Karamchedu, Andhra Pradesh, 1984: Five SCs were massacred. The trial
court convicted many of the accused. The high court acquitted all. The Supreme
Court upheld the trial court judgment – a clear example that acquittals do not
mean false cases.
 Tsunduru, Andhra Pradesh, 1991: Eight SCs were massacred. The trial court
convicted the accused in 2007. The high court acquitted them in 2014. The
Supreme Court has admitted a special leave petition (SLP) of the surviving
victims and survivors of victims.
 Six cases of Bihar including the Bathani Tola (1996) and Laxmanpur Bathe
(1997). In most of these, the trial court convicted the accused. In all of these, the
high court acquitted the accused. Appeals are pending in the Supreme Court.
 Kambalapalli, Karnataka. The prime witness in this case, who is the sole
survivor and head of the family whose other members were massacred, turned
―hostile‖ due to a threat of life, resulting in the acquittal of all the accused.
Sexual Violence on Dalit Women
Rape, murder, and maiming of dalit women by upper caste men, as retaliation for
aspirations of the community for economic and social progress, still continues in the
villages and towns of independent India. Lower caste women are raped as part of
caste customs and village traditions and are forced to have sex with upper caste
landlords and the police. Rape is often used as a form of retaliation to suppress
movements demanding payment of minimum wages.
These are not isolated incidents but routine occurrences. One hears of several such
examples of maintaining the social hierarchy of gendered citizenship. For instance,
during the period of 1,300 days from Dec 7, 2003 to June 30, 2007, 1,217 gang rapes
were reported in the Madhya Pradesh as per the State Assembly records. Out of
these, 362 cases were of women from scheduled castes, 310 were of women from
scheduled tribes, and 381 were of women from other backward castes.
65
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
An example of this social hierarchy of gendered citizenship through which rights get
constituted, is that while the Constitution empowered women through reservations
to local panchayats by enacting the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution,
newspapers continue to carry reports of dalit women sarpanches (panchayat heads)
being paraded naked and humiliated for holding these positions. Rape of dalit
women continues to be a common occurrence with around 1172 dalit women having
been raped during the year 2005, as reflected in the statistics compiled by the
National Crime Record Bureau.
Another report revealed that rape of Dalit women in Gujarat rose by 500 per cent
since 2001 over the last 13 years, reaching a high point in 2014. While in 2001 only
14 Dalit women reported rape, in 2014 there were 74 Dalit women who reported
rape and their cases were registered under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code
and Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (popularly
referred to as ‗Atrocities Act‘).
While most of these violations go unchecked, the gruesome killing of a dalit woman
along with her seventeen year old daughter and two sons, in Khairlanji village in
Bhandara district of Maharashtra in September 2006, made national headlines when
six people were convicted with death penalty and two with a sentence of life
imprisonment by the sessions judge at Bhandara in September, 2008. This was a
major landmark victory for dalit and human rights activists. Despite this, it is clear
that issues concerning both gender and caste were invisibalised in the judicial
discourse. As far as caste issues are concerned, the accused were charged with
murder under section 302 of the IPC, but were acquitted of charges under Atrocities
Act. The activists felt that this glossed over the atrocities committed upon citizens
solely due to their caste positions. In August 2010, the Nagpur Bench of Mumbai
High Court upheld the Session‘s Court ruling which had termed the atrocities as
mere criminal acts committed out of human rage, leading to a non-application of the
provisions of Atrocities Act.
The invisibalisation of gender occurred when the courts negated the sexual abuse of
the women. Despite the fact that preliminary investigations revealed that the mother,
66
Complied by Majlis Legal center for IIT Kanpur
Surekha and the daughter Priyanka were sexually abused prior to their killings, the
sexual violence inflicted upon the two women did not receive due judicial
recognition both at the Sessions Court as well as the High Court. This despite the
fact that the body of Priyanka was found stripped of all clothes. The High Court
concluded that since revenge was the motive, there was no intention on the part of
the accused to insult the deceased women or to dishonour or outrage their modesty.
While both gender and caste were invisibalised, only the crime of murder which
comes within the ambit of Section 302 of the IPC was upheld. While the Sessions
Court declared that it was a rarest of rare case warranting death penalty, at the High
Court level even the ‗rarest of rare‘ crime was further diluted into an ordinary
murder warranting only life imprisonment.
As this case highlights, while the sexual brutalities committed on dalit and tribal
women are on the increase, rape and sexual abuse of lower caste and marginalized
women are seldom examined within the matrix of the intersectionality of caste and
gender. The reported cases constitute only the tip of the iceberg as a large number of
cases do not even get recorded. Even those reported and charge sheeted seldom
result in conviction. The Khairlanji verdict is a rare judicial occurrence. A
combination of factors contributes to this dismal state of affairs. Non accessibility of
the justice delivery system to marginalised communities due to factors of poverty,
illiteracy and fear of the police is one contributory factor. Institutional bias of state
agencies against dalits, leading to biased and callous investigation and prosecution is
another. Retraction by eye witnesses from the higher castes is yet another factor. The
caste and gender bias in courts of law is a further contributing factor.
17. NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR WOMEN
The National Commission for Women (NCW) is a statutory body established in
January 1992 under the 1990 National Commission for Women Act. It‘s mandate is

Parivarik Mahila Lok Adalats
The National Commission of Women has evolved an innovative concept of Parivarik
Mahila LokAdalat (PMLA), which supplements the efforts of the District Legal
Service Authority (DLSA) for redressal and speedy disposal of the matters related to
marriage and family affairs pending in various courts. The Parivarik Mahila
LokAdalat functions on the model of the Lok Adalat. The Commission provides
financial assistance to NGOs or State Women Commissions or State Legal Service
Authority to organize the Parivarik Mahila Lok Adalat. The objectives of Parivarik
Mahila Lok Adalat are as follows:
 To provide speedy and cost free dispensation of justice to women.
 To generate awareness among the public regarding conciliatory mode of dispute
settlement.

 To gear up the process of organizing the Lok Adalats and to encourage the public
to settle their disputes outside the formal set-up.
 To empower public especially women to participate in justice delivery
mechanism.
Issues around working of NCW
The Major Issues around working of the National Commission for Women are as
follows:
 NCW‘s functions are dependent on the grants offered by the central
government. Financial assistance provided to the Commission is inadequate
to meet its needs.
 NCW‘s members are appointed by the government and the commission does
not have power to select its own members.
 NCW lacks concrete legislative power. It enjoys power only to recommend
amendments and submit reports.
 The recommendations of the NCW are not binding on the Union or state
governments.
 Often it takes action only of the issues are brought to light. Unreported cases
of suppression and oppression are generally ignored by the Commission.
 NCW‘s jurisdiction is not operative in Jammu and Kashmir.
Drawbacks
 It has no actual legislative powers. It only has the powers to suggest amendments
and submit reports which are not obligatory on state or Union Governments.
 It does not have the power to choose its own members. The power selecting
members is vested with the Union Government and the nature of country‘s
volatile political scenario tends the commission to be politicized.
 It is reliant on financial assistance from the Union Government and this could
compromise the independence of the Commission.

About Majlis
Our Motto: Transforming Victims into Survivors
―Transforming a victim into a survivor is a long drawn process. It is not a
matter of merely changing the vocabulary, while keeping intact an
oppressive system which constantly re-victimizes her, causes her extreme
trauma and brings her down several notches in the social ladder from
where she was, prior to the abuse. She becomes a survivor only when she
emerges stronger for having walked through this intimidating system,
with someone extending a helping hand, and in the process transforms
the system itself, rendering it more humane. It is our hope that having
responded to their needs, we helped each of them to overcome their
vulnerabilities, and attain their goals and aspirations, beyond their ‗case‘
and become survivors.‖
